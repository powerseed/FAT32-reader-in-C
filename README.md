# How to run:
Issue `./fat32 [imagename] info` to run the program in "info" mode. 
<br>
Issue `./fat32 [imagename] list` to run the program in "list" mode. 
<br>
Issue `./fat32 imagename get [absolute path]` to run the program in "get" mode.

# Note:
My solution:
* supports **long name** in both "**list**" and "**get**" mode.
* only prints .txt files in "get" mode.
